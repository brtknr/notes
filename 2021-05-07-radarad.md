The health checks can still be improved however checking Prometheus alerts and cluster pods to see if they are running still a good measure to check health of the applications. For more details you can check application logs for exceptions. If you need more information like how to check applications health internally we can also provide them.
Also here is a rough list to externally check applications availability:
